			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>				
				I was born in Hamilton Hospital on the 22nd of August in 1997. I have lived in Hamilton and Auckland and only left the country twice, firstly when I was 7 to the Gold Coast, and secondly to Vanuatu when I was 11.
			</p>
			<p>
				I attained a first degree black belt in Kiaido Ryu Martial Arts on the 4th of July 2014, but have since stopped practicing. I am and have been an avid gamer for the majority of my life. The highest point in my gaming career would probably be when I was in the top 10 players for osu!mania in New Zealand back in mid 2015. I now regularly play with a group of 4 of my close friends on a day to day basis, playing mainly League of Legends, Dark Souls (1-3), and Warframe.
			</p>
			<p>
				My ambitions for the future are to resume practicing Kiaido Ryu one day in the future, and to finish construction of my blacksmithing forge (if you know where to buy fire bricks please contact me).
